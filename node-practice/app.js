// Order is important in Routing. (If you put the 404 route before the other routes, it will never be reached because the other routes will match first.)
// Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
// Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
// 1. Execute any code.
// 2. Make changes to the request and response objects.
// 3. End the request-response cycle.
// 4. Call the next middleware function in the stack.
// If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. If no middleware function is left, the request will be left hanging
